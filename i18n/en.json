This upcoming vote is an opportunity for you and your colleagues in Parliament to acknowledge the realities of the digital age and harmonize our copyright law to match those realities.",

	"eucc-email-part-two": "Finally, I urge you consider these improvements to copyright without imposing additional restrictions. There should not be pre-filtering obligations for platform providers because they will fundamentally turn the internet into medium where people can only communicate after receiving a company’s permission. This will hurt the culture of sharing that is necessary for Wikipedia to grow and flourish.",
